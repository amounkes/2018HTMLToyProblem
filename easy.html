				<h2>Material Girl</h2>
					<p>
						While some may argue that Marlowe's Barabas either loves or loathes his daughter, a clear-cut answer may not necessarily be easily determined. Barabas shows both affection and hatred toward Abigall, though he doesn't treat her like a person until after she has truly converted to Catholicism (when he then murders her). 
					</p>
					<p>
						At the play's beginning, it seems that Barabas may have some sort of affection towards his only daughter. Upon further examination, however, it becomes clear that Barabas only cares for his daughter as long as she is of some monetary value to him. His willingness to use Abigall to regain his gold showcases this perfectly. Barabas's attitude regarding his daughter is also demonstrated during his conversation with Lodowick wherein he describes Abigall as a "diamond" (2.3.49-69). Additionally, Barabas earlier equates Abigall with gold, saying "O my girl, / My gold" and "O Abigall, Abigall, that I had thee here too! / Then all my desires were fully satisfied. / But I will practice thy enlargement thence" (2.1.46-47, 50-52).
					</p>
					<p>
						These lines emphasize the notion that Abigall is truly her father's property, a literal jewel to be bought and sold on the male marketplace. This comparison of Abigall to property is further reinforced when one considers that the verbal exchange between Barabas and Lodowick takes place at a slave market. Add in the fact that Barabas embraces his bags of gold rather than Abigall and rarely offers her any sort of affection or comforting words, and it appears that Barabas doesn't truly love Abigall; rather, he simply views her as another manifestation of material wealth (though to be honest, he is quite fond of his material possessions, so there may exist some admiration for his daughter).

				<h2>Murder in Malta</h2>
					<p>
							Should the murder of Abigall then be reason to suspect hatred or love? In early modern England (and Malta, by geographical extension), "honor killings" weren't exactly unheard of, so it is possible that a Protestant audience may have seen Abigall's death as appropriate (probably more so if it weren't executed by a Jew and a Moor). Considering the paradox of virginity, it also seems likely that a Protestant audience would have seen Abigall's decision to enter a nunnery as a waste of a good virgin (even the friars think it's a waste: "Ay, and a virgin, too, that grieves me most" (3.6.41)). If Abigall becomes a nun, she can't give away her oh-so-precious jewel, the only thing worth having and the only thing a woman could have. If she is essentially throwing away her chastity by wasting it (by early modern standards) she has no reason to live anymore. One could almost argue that Barabas is a kind and loving father that is actually doing his daughter a favor. 
						</p>
						<p>
							That is, until the fourth act of the play, when Barabas loses any hope at redemption and says of Abigall, "I grieve because she lived so long" (4.1.19). At this point, we must accept that Barabas is truly evil, only caring for wealth and power, and nothing of his daughter.
